## ISBN Rules and Assumptions
* Two books with the same ISBN must have the same title and author.
* Two books with the same title and author but different ISBNs are treated as different books.
* Multiple copies of books with the same ISBN are allowed.
* Borrowers and books must be registered before borrowing or returning operations.
* A book can only be borrowed by one borrower at a time.
* Validation ensures meaningful data is provided for borrowers and books.
